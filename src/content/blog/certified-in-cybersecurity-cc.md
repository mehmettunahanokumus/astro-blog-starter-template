🔐 Thinking about starting a career in cybersecurity?

Breaking into this field can feel overwhelming and there's too many certifications, too many paths. But one of the best starting points out there right now is the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) from ISC², the same global organization behind CISSP.

💡 Why it stands out:

🔸 It’s vendor-neutral, meaning it focuses on core cybersecurity principles and not specific products or technologies.

🔸 It’s completely free to train for and take, thanks to ISC²’s One Million Certified in Cybersecurity initiative.

🔸 It’s designed for beginners, with no prior experience or degree required.

It covers the five foundational domains of cybersecurity:
1️⃣ Security Principles
2️⃣ Incident Response & Business Continuity
3️⃣ Access Controls
4️⃣ Network Security
5️⃣ Security Operations

🌍 The CC is recognized globally and can give you an advantage when applying for entry-level cybersecurity or IT roles. It’s also an ideal foundation for progressing toward certifications like CompTIA Security+, SSCP, or CISSP later on.

🎓 Whether you’re a student, IT professional, or someone planning a career switch, this is one of the most accessible, credible, and vendor-neutral ways to start learning cybersecurity.
